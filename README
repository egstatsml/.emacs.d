My Emacs configuration that I use on most systems.
Slight alterations may need to be made for running on some systems (such as high performance clusters without a display environment)

Where possible, I have tried to list other peoples code as a submodle.

For those that arent possible (because I could not find them on Git)
or those from the Emacs Wiki, the links are provided as:
